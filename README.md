# MotorDome Operating Manual

This is a photo copy of the Operating Manual for the MotorDome pinball machine.

Game No: OE14

Form No: OE14-00300-0100

This repository contains all of the images of the manual that we had.  The manual was in pretty good condition so we suspect everything to be complete and nothing is missing.
